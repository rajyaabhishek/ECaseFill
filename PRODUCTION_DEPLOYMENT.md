# Production Deployment Guide

## âœ… Payment Integration Status

Your payment integration is **WORKING CORRECTLY** in test mode! The successful test payment confirms:

- âœ… Cashfree API integration is functional
- âœ… Order creation and verification work properly
- âœ… Payment flow from frontend to backend is complete
- âœ… User subscription updates are implemented

## ðŸš€ Steps for Production Deployment

### 1. **Update Environment Variables**

Create production `.env` file with:

```bash
# Production Cashfree Credentials
REACT_APP_CASHFREE_APP_ID=your_production_app_id
REACT_APP_CASHFREE_SECRET_KEY=your_production_secret_key
REACT_APP_CASHFREE_ENVIRONMENT=production

# Set Node Environment
NODE_ENV=production

# Other existing variables
REACT_APP_AI_API_KEY=your_ai_api_key
REACT_APP_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=your_clerk_key
CLERK_SECRET_KEY=your_clerk_secret
```

### 2. **Update Domain URLs**

In the following files, replace `yourdomain.com` with your actual domain:

**server/index.js:**
- Line 29: `"https://yourdomain.com/return?order_id={order_id}"`
- Line 31: `"https://yourdomain.com/webhook"`

**src/components/PaymentButton.js:**
- Line 35: `https://yourdomain.com/payment?${queryParams}`
- Line 58: `https://yourdomain.com/verify`

### 3. **Get Production Cashfree Credentials**

1. Go to [Cashfree Dashboard](https://merchant.cashfree.com/)
2. Switch to **Production** mode
3. Navigate to **Developers > API Keys**
4. Copy your Production App ID and Secret Key
5. Update your `.env` file

### 4. **Deploy Server**

Your server needs to be deployed and accessible at your domain. Options:
- **Heroku**: Easy deployment with git
- **AWS/DigitalOcean**: VPS deployment
- **Vercel/Netlify**: Serverless functions

### 5. **Test Production Payment**

1. Use a real payment method (small amount like â‚¹1)
2. Verify the payment appears in your Cashfree dashboard
3. Check that user subscription is updated in Clerk
4. Confirm credits are added to user account

## ðŸ”§ Code Changes Made

### Fixed Issues:
1. **âœ… Customer Details**: Now uses actual user info from Clerk
2. **âœ… Environment URLs**: Automatically switches between dev/prod
3. **âœ… Production Environment**: Cashfree switches to production mode
4. **âœ… User Authentication**: Validates user is signed in before payment

### Current Flow:
1. User clicks "Buy" button
2. System checks if user is signed in
3. Creates order with real user details (email, name, phone)
4. Processes payment through Cashfree
5. Verifies payment on backend
6. Updates user subscription in Clerk
7. Adds credits to user account
8. Shows success message
